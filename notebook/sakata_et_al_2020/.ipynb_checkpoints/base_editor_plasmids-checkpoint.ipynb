    "The Target-AID plasmid (pCMV-Target-AID) was constructed by assembling two fragments encoding the N- and C-terminus halves of Target-AID, which were both amplified from pcDNA3.1_pCMV-nCas-PmCDA1-ugi pH1-gRNA(HPRT) (Addgene 79620) using primer pairs RS045/HM129 and HM128/RS046, respectively, with a backbone fragment amplified from pCMV-ABE7.10 using RS047/RS048. \n",

    "To construct the Target-AIDmax plasmid (pCMV-Target-AIDmax), the pUC-optimized-PmCDA1-ugi plasmid encoding the codon-optimized C-terminal region of Target-AIDmax was first constructed by the gene synthesis service of GenScript. This C terminus fragment was then amplified with primer pair SI1304/SI1307 and assembled with a nCas9 fragment amplified from pCMV-BE4max using SI945/SI1308 and a backbone fragment amplified from pCMV-ABEmax using SI1310/SI1309. \n",

    "The BE4max(C) plasmid (pCMV-BE4max(C)) was constructed to replace the C-terminal region of Target-AIDmax with the codon-optimized rAPOBEC1 and 2×UGI domains of BE4max. To this end, an nCas9 fragment obtained from pCMV-Target-AIDmax using SI447/SI1105 was assembled with rAPOBEC1 and 2×UGI fragments obtained from BE4max using SI1352/SI1357 and SI1359/SI1350, respectively, and a backbone obtained from pCMV-BE4max using SI1351/SI448. \n",
